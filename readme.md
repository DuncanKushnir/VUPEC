# Vehicle Use Phase Energy Calculator (VUPEC)
Author:Duncan Kushnir (dk@duncankushnir.com)

## Purpose
To provide an accurate and modifiable model for calculating the energy requirements of vehicles. 

## Scope
From first physics principles through to energy inputs to the vehicle (petrol, natural_gas
, electricity at plug, etc.)

## Features
- All relevant drive cycles included as well as parsing engine.. paint your own!
- Accurate physics, even with altitude and temperature corrections
- Fully separate import engine for vehicles and components
- Calculates standard driving cycle energy use to within 5% of reported - all vehicle makes, all
 drive cycles
 - graph friendly result dumping
 - launch from excel control panel or from JSON-rpc
 
 ##### In progress
 - Monte Carlo testing of variable sensitivity (wiring up)
